        <p>Why do I love this book? Because: </p>
        <un>
            <li>The story made me root for both sides. I had really sympathized the concerns of the students in the Evil School; judged because of their low status, bereft of any consideration because of their parents' mistakes, and forced to take the deplorable way of life because of the society's prejudice.</li>
            <li>I loved the story's pacing. It gave me enough time to dwell into the events, understand the graveness of a current situation, and empathize with every character. I can't even hate a single person in the book because I witnessed their suffering.</li>
            <li>I also loved how the book portrayed that your family's history can never dictate you as an individual. Our actions are the ones that define us. Our own beliefs, principles, capacity to prioritize the wellness of other more than our own are the things that make us good or evil.</li>
